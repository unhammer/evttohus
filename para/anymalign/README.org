* Usage
  You need the tsv's in ../../words and ../../words-src-fad, so do
  : cd ../..
  : make words

  Then a =make= here will check out anymalign, and if Python2 is
  installed will prepare the corpus and start aligning.

  Once you feel you've let it run long enough, end it by doing =echo >
  /path/to/stop_aligning= as instructed by the script, and make will
  merge the alignments.

  You can now type =make eval= to see the evaluation.
