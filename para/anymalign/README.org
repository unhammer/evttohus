* Usage
  You need the tsv's in ../../words and ../../fadwords, so do
  : cd ../..
  : make anymalign-pre
  first.

  Then a =make= here will check out anymalign, and if Python2 is
  installed will prepare the corpus and start aligning.

  Once you feel you've let it run long enough, end it by doing =echo >
  /path/to/stop_aligning= as instructed by the script, and make will
  merge the alignments.

  You can now type =make eval= to see the evaluation ("gold set"
  numbers only make sense if you compiled with DOEVAL=true in the
  =Makefile=).

  You can get the results into the toplevel out/ folder by doing
  : cd ../..
  : make anymalign-post
  : make

* Limitations
  For now, only nob2sma set up.
