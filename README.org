Various scripts and such used to create dictionary candidates for nob2smj
and nob2sma from nob2sme dictionary + corpora.

Run =make= to make the stuff; the first time around you need to also run
=make corpus=.

The results will appear in the =out/= directory, where e.g.
=out/smesmj= has a two-column format where the first word is a sme
input and the second is a smj candidate.

The files in =out/nobsmjsme= and =out/nobsmasme= include both nob and
sme translations for the candidates, annotated with normalised
frequencies for all the three words. The format is, tab-separated:

: nob	candidate	sme	fr_nob	fr_candidate	fr_sme

* TODO simple rules for loans
  | nob          | smj            | sme           |
  |--------------+----------------+---------------|
  | transkribere | transkribierit | transkriberit |
  | initiere     | initieret      | initieret     |

  If we need nob, we can't rely on xfst alone.
  
* TODO kintel, for nobsmj
* TODO pretty.sh should include a "source" field or something
  when we get kintel in there, we need to differentiate if something
  came from nobsmj or smesmj
  
* TODO shorten corpora to size of the smallest for comparable frequencies?
  Currently, =pretty.sh= will simply divide the sum of the larger by
  the sum of the smallest corpus.

* TODO use forms or lms for frequency?
  Some of the dictionary entries are have 0 hits in lms, but hits in
  forms (TV-nyheter), but we still get less 0's by using lms

  Could lemmatise before looking up frequency, but this is complicated
  enough already â€¦

* TODO kwic-annotate out-files
