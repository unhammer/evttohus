* TODO freq_annotate doesn't work for sme/when/multiple/alternatives
* TODO include unchecked of kintel
  with some simple heuristics to remove the worst stuff:
   : <words/nobsmj/N.tsv.unchecked gawk 'BEGIN{OFS=FS="\t"} $2{for(i=2;i<=NF;i++)if($i~/^[( ]*[[:alpha:]]{0,3}[*) ]*$|[?-]$/)$i="";print}'

* TODO follow synsets in order to expand existing translations
  The nobsma dict has arbeidsform→barkoevuekie already.

  The fadwords list has "arbeidsmåte", for which we have no candidate.
  But arbeidsform and arbeidsmåte are ~synonymous. In fact,
  smjnob/N.tsv contains
  : arggovuohke arbeidsmåte     arbeidsstilling arbeidsform     prosedyre
  so we've already got the "synset" via dictionaries

  Could add NWN, but it may be a bit too fine-grained – e.g.
  dictionaries give {opposisjon,motstand,gjenstridighet,trass}, while
  NWN has {opposisjon} as a hyponym of {motstand}.

** TODO apertium-sme-nob seems to have some synonyms not in words/dicts  
** TODO find synonyms (expand <tg>) by comparing dicts
   Say one candidate is
   | sma          | nob         |
   |--------------+-------------|
   | barkoevuekie | arbeidsform |
   but the smenob dictionary also contains
   | sme   | nob    |
   |-------+--------|
   | málle | form   |
   | málle | modell |
   | málle | måte   |
   then we can go from (vuekie,form) and look up nob in smenob, giving
   (málle,form), and look up the sme side to find (málle,{form,modell,måte}),
   which finally gives us (vuekie,{form,modell,måte}), and we end up with
   | sma          | nob           |
   |--------------+---------------|
   | barkoevuekie | arbeidsform   |
   | barkoevuekie | arbeidsmodell |
   | barkoevuekie | arbeidsmåte   |
* TODO possible to generate loans directly from nob for sma as well?
* TODO kwic-annotate out-files?
  sentences with hits in freq/*para-kwic now, but 1) not actually
  kwic, and 2) maybe more useful with just monolingual hits since then
  we at least get them for more of the words …
* TODO derivations mess up pos-filtering
  e.g. anymalign gives satsing→joekedimmie; seems good, but then the
  lemmatising gives "joekedidh":
  
  joekedimmie     joekedidh+V+TV+Der/NomAct+N+Sg+Nom

  "joekedidh" is the wrong PoS when doing noun candidates, should we
  output "joekedidh+Der/NomAct" (more work for linguist) or even just
  ignore it? Using forms for all anymalign output is even more work.
  Could perhaps use forms only when there is a Der-tag right before
  the main PoS tag …
  
* TODO also try non-fad words for the sources that give the best candidates
  or for high frequency candidates etc.

* TODO shorten corpora to size of the smallest for comparable frequencies?
  Currently, =canonicalise.sh= will simply divide the sum of the larger by
  the sum of the smallest corpus.
* TODO run through usmjNorm and take lemmas for words marked Err/Sub ?
* TODO sub-word correspondences
  A level between the current xfst (spelling/phon) and decomp.

  Make char-gram frequency list for *correspondending pairs*,
  something like

  |    f | sme   | smj   |
  |------+-------+-------|
  | 1200 | á     | á     |
  |  391 | laš   | lasj  |
  |  341 | buvs  | båvs  |
  |  332 | hte   | hte   |
  |  201 | htit  | htet  |
  |  112 | ja    | jáv   |
  |   93 | halla | dalla |
  |   12 | áli   | állá  |
  |   12 | anb   | amb   |

  We might eventually apply the longer of these in the xfst step with
  priority union, or have a separate candidate generator using e.g.
  beam search on frequency.

  Could use moses by turning seed word-lists into sentences, so
  : adni - addne
  becomes
  : a d n i - a d d n e
  
  (though we already find compound-part correspondences with _precomp,
  maybe enough …)
* TODO moses? berkelyaligner? fastalign?
