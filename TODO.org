* TODO also try non-fad words for the sources that give the best candidates
  or for high frequency candidates etc.

* TODO Kintel, for nobsmj
  http://gtweb.uit.no/webdict/ak/smj2nob/index.html
  
* TODO pretty.sh should include a "source" field or something
  when we get kintel in there, we need to differentiate if something
  came from nobsmj or smesmj

* TODO shorten corpora to size of the smallest for comparable frequencies?
  Currently, =pretty.sh= will simply divide the sum of the larger by
  the sum of the smallest corpus.

* TODO kwic-annotate out-files

* TODO run through usmjNorm and take lemmas for words marked Err/Sub ?
