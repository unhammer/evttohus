* TODO include concatenated dynamic-compound lemmas in freq/*combined*?
  now that we're running out of corpus-covered analyses
* TODO use bad-marked candidates as input to precomp-ranking?
* TODO use nouns from apertium for making decomp sme→sma
  since with decomp, sme→smj was so much better than nob→smj, we
  should really try decomp sme→smj.

  words/dicts/{smasme,smesma} don't have the nouns, use the ones from
  apertium instead
* TODO precomp-productivity as frequency?
  sort tmp/nobsmj/N_precomp_goodparts |uniq -c|sort -nr|head

  -----

  In fact we could do EM on it, where Σ_smj p(smj|nob)=1 for smj-parts
  that are possible translations of the nob-part; and
  p(nob1 nob2 → smj1 smj2) = p(smj1|nob1)*p(smj2|nob2);
  unknown pairs would get some very low p.

  This would at least give us a confidence score for candidates not
  seen in corpus.
  
* TODO try cross.sh for more triplets
* TODO freq_annotate doesn't work for sme/when/multiple/alternatives
* TODO include unchecked of kintel
  with some simple heuristics to remove the worst stuff:
   : <words/nobsmj/N.tsv.unchecked gawk 'BEGIN{OFS=FS="\t"} $2{for(i=2;i<=NF;i++)if($i~/^[( ]*[[:alpha:]]{0,3}[*) ]*$|[?-]$/)$i="";print}'

* TODO follow synsets in order to expand existing translations [1/2]
  The nobsma dict has arbeidsform→barkoevuekie already.

  The fadwords list has "arbeidsmåte", for which we have no candidate.
  But arbeidsform and arbeidsmåte are ~synonymous. In fact,
  smjnob/N.tsv contains
  : arggovuohke arbeidsmåte     arbeidsstilling arbeidsform     prosedyre
  so we've already got the "synset" via dictionaries

  Could add NWN, but it may be a bit too fine-grained – e.g.
  dictionaries give {opposisjon,motstand,gjenstridighet,trass}, while
  NWN has {opposisjon} as a hyponym of {motstand}.


  There are two main ways to use the synsets:
  1. [ ] Before running sme2smjify and decomp/precomp, we expand the
     fadwords lists with synonyms. For example, we have the synset
     {toppstilling,lederstilling} (via smjnob); fad contains
     "toppstilling" but not "lederstilling". If we only run decomp on
     the one word when doing smanob, we only get to try translating
     topp#stilling, while the sma word might be better translated by
     leder#stilling (who knows).
  2. [X] If fad contains both synonyms, but our dictionaries contain
     only one, we get the other synonym for free. E.g. smjnob says
     that {arbeidsmåte,arbeidsform} and both of these are in fad. Now
     if we've added "arbeidsmåte" to nobsma, we can get "arbeidsform"
     in there for free. Implemented in =expand-synonyms.sh=, though
     with room for improvement.

     
** TODO apertium-sme-nob seems to have some synonyms not in words/dicts  
* TODO possible to generate loans directly from nob for sma as well?
* TODO kwic-annotate out-files?
  sentences with hits in freq/*para-kwic now, but 1) not actually
  kwic, and 2) maybe more useful with just monolingual hits since then
  we at least get them for more of the words …
* TODO derivations mess up pos-filtering
  e.g. anymalign gives satsing→joekedimmie; seems good, but then the
  lemmatising gives "joekedidh":
  
  joekedimmie     joekedidh+V+TV+Der/NomAct+N+Sg+Nom

  "joekedidh" is the wrong PoS when doing noun candidates, should we
  output "joekedidh+Der/NomAct" (more work for linguist) or even just
  ignore it? Using forms for all anymalign output is even more work.
  Could perhaps use forms only when there is a Der-tag right before
  the main PoS tag …
  
* TODO also try non-fad words for the sources that give the best candidates
  or for high frequency candidates etc.

* TODO shorten corpora to size of the smallest for comparable frequencies?
  Currently, =canonicalise.sh= will simply divide the sum of the larger by
  the sum of the smallest corpus.
* TODO run through usmjNorm and take lemmas for words marked Err/Sub ?
* TODO sub-word correspondences
  A level between the current xfst (spelling/phon) and decomp.

  Make char-gram frequency list for *correspondending pairs*,
  something like

  |    f | sme   | smj   |
  |------+-------+-------|
  | 1200 | á     | á     |
  |  391 | laš   | lasj  |
  |  341 | buvs  | båvs  |
  |  332 | hte   | hte   |
  |  201 | htit  | htet  |
  |  112 | ja    | jáv   |
  |   93 | halla | dalla |
  |   12 | áli   | állá  |
  |   12 | anb   | amb   |

  We might eventually apply the longer of these in the xfst step with
  priority union, or have a separate candidate generator using e.g.
  beam search on frequency.

  Could use moses by turning seed word-lists into sentences, so
  : adni - addne
  becomes
  : a d n i - a d d n e
  
  (though we already find compound-part correspondences with _precomp,
  maybe enough …)
* TODO moses? berkelyaligner? fastalign?
